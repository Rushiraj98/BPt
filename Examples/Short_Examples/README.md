The folder contains a number of "Short Examples" which tend to focus on one particular concept in more detail, and are typically geared towards a more advanced auidience.

- Explore_Various_Functions.ipynb contains an example using synthetic data to highlight and explain a few different sometime hard to find functionalities of the library. These include mostly different strategies for loading and working with missing data and imputation. That said, there are some other explanations on how to use various BPt features.

- Custom_Loaders.ipynb contains an example using fake data (random numpy arrays). This notebook is designed as a reference for how to compose different loading steps together and to add custom hyper-parameters dists.

- Loader_Caching_and_Search.ipynb contains a brief example showing how cachine can be used with custom loader objects. This notebook using data from the developing human connectome project, specifically volumetric timeseries derrived from the stop signal task. This is a fairly advanced example with very limited commentary right now.
