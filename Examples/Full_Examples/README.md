This folder contains Full_Examples, which aim to be notebooks covering more complete projects, i.e., from loading to results.


- Binary_Sex.ipynb makes use of data from the ABCD Study to explore a simple workflow example. In this notebook, sex at birth is predicted from structural MRI derrived regions of interest. This example relative to some of the others contains a great deal more explanation / tutorial-esque text, making it suitable for those new to the library as a starting place.

- Binary_Drug_Dependence.ipynb makes use of data from the ENIGMA Addiction Consortium to explore the binary classification problem of predicting between participents with any drug dependence vs. resepective controls. This example is interesting in that due to the multi-site and study nature of the data, a number of unique more advanced machine learning considerations must be taken into account.
